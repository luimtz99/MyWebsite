        <h2> About Me </h2> 
     </div>   
<p> Hello everyone, my name is Luis Martinez! This will be my first time learning how to develop web pages and use HTML which I'm excited to learn this semester. I also wanted to give this class a shot. Two college goal that I want to achieve is transferring to CSULB and working towards a bachelor's in computer science. One thing I enjoying doing this past couple of months is working out 5 days out of the week making sure to be consistent as possible. I also like playing all types of video games and watching sports. I don't have experience with developing web pages or javascript but I do have some experience with programming languages like python and C++. My goal for this class is to gain useful knowledge in this course and possibly use it to create a personal website in the future! </p>
