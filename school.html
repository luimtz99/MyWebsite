<p>One of my goals is to transfer to CSULB hopefully in the near future! Some of the reasons I want to go to CSULB are that it's close to home, enjoyed my time touring the campus,  and I heard CSULB has some great computer science programs. In addition,  my godmother graduated from CSULB back in 2016 with a master's in Social Work. She's been a helpful mentor throughout my three years in college so far! </p> </div>
